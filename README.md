#### ABOUT THE PLUGIN

This plugin is specifically designed for game servers hosting mods like surf, kz, and bhop to effectively address the issue of lacking basic equipment—a knife—on certain maps. In these mods, a knife is often essential for an optimal gameplay experience, but not all maps automatically provide players with one at the start of the game.
